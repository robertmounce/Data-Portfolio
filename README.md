Project 1: [WFR Bike Maintaince] (Python) 
The WheelFun Rentals Data Project involved developing a product management system for a bike rental company, drawing on my two years of experience as a mechanic there. Using Notion for data collection and the Chillipepper API for real-time status updates via QR codes, I managed over 300 products across four locations. This project improved operational efficiency by processing and analyzing 400 repair reports, ensuring timely maintenance and optimal service delivery.
