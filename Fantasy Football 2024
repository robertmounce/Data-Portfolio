I have 30 days to create a draft sheet with the amount of best players.\n. Data Collection and Preparation:\n\nHistorical Player Data: Gather data on player performance from previous seasons, including metrics like fantasy points, yardage, touchdowns, receptions, etc.\n\nInjury Reports: Include historical injury data and recovery times.\n\nTeam Statistics: Collect data on team performance, offensive/defensive rankings, and changes in coaching staff or schemes.\n\nADP (Average Draft Position): Find data on where players are typically drafted in fantasy leagues.\n\n2. Data Cleaning and Exploration:\n\nClean the data by handling missing values, correcting errors, and ensuring consistency.\nPerform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key trends and factors influencing player performance.\n\n3. Player Projection Model:\n\nRegression Analysis: Use regression models to predict player performance for the upcoming season. Factors can include previous performance, age, team changes, and injury history.\nMachine Learning Models: Experiment with machine learning models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks to improve prediction accuracy.\n\n4. Draft Strategy Optimization:\n\nValue-Based Drafting (VBD): Calculate the value of each player compared to a baseline (replacement-level) player. This helps in identifying which players provide the most value relative to their position.\n\t•\tPositional Scarcity: Analyze the availability of high-performing players at each position to determine the optimal time to draft certain positions.\n\t•\tTiers and Rankings: Group players into tiers based on their projected performance. This helps in making decisions when choosing between players of similar value.\n\n5. Interactive Draft Tool:\n\nPlayer Rankings and Projections: Create a dynamic list of player rankings and projections, updating as the draft progresses.\nDraft Recommendations: Provide recommendations based on the user’s current team composition, positional needs, and best available players.\nSimulated Drafts: Allow users to simulate drafts to practice and understand different strategies.\n\n6. Visualization and User Interface:\n\nDashboards: Create interactive dashboards displaying player stats, projections, and draft strategy metrics.\nGraphs and Charts: Use visualizations to compare players, show positional trends, and highlight key insights.\n\n7. Documentation and Insights:\n\nMethodology: Document the methodology, including data sources, model selection, and assumptions.\n\nInsights and Recommendations: Provide insights from the analysis and recommend strategies for drafting, such as focusing on certain positions in early rounds.\n\n8. Testing and Validation:\n\nBacktesting: Test your models and draft strategies using historical data to evaluate their effectiveness.\n\nUser Feedback: If possible, gather feedback from other fantasy football enthusiasts to refine the tool.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
